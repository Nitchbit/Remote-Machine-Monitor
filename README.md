# Remote Machine Monitor

System Machine Monitor is a tool designed for private and company, with lots of remote machines that always have to be monitored. It's possible to monitor devices wherever you are, the only thing you need is an internet connection.

SystemMonitor allows you to monitor several system's metrics. It's compatible with cluster of Docker's containers running on linux and with systems debian-based.

This tool is based on a client-server architecture, in which the server monitors the clients through metrics and graphs.

## Client

The [client](SystemMonitor/Client) represents the system to be monitored and is composed by three tools:
- [Promtheus Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter);
- [CAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor);
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/);

The first one, Prometheus Node Exporter, allows to expose hardware and OS metrics. It is written in Go and in this project is used to monitor the machine in which it is installed.

The second one, cAdvisor, is a docker's image created by Google that provides container users an understanding of the resources usage and performance characteristics of their running containers.

The last one, Prometheus, scrapes informations from the previous two and stores them. Prometheus is reachable from anywhere thanks to the exposure of the port to the web, in this project it's used by Grafana (see below).  

## Server

The main component on the [server](SystemMonitor/Server) side is [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

Grafana is the most popular technology used to compose observability dashboards with everything. 
In this project Grafana uses informations scraped by Prometheus and creates SystemMonitor's dashboards for analisys of the main components of remote machines.

It is reachable from anywhere and any device, at the address and port specified, as long as you made it accessible outside your local network. 

The second component in the server side is a plugin for Grafana, [grafana-image-renderer](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-image-renderer) needed to setup the alerting channel based on Telegram.

The alerts are settable as you prefer quickly and easly directly from Grafana interface. Grafana will send alerts whenever a value from Prometheus breaks the threshould setted by the user. The alerts will arrive directly on your device with Telegram installed, with a snap of the situation on the remote machine.
